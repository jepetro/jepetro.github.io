                <h3><a href="https://www.lingscars.com/" target="_blank">Bad Website</a></h3>
                <p>This Website is for a car leasing business in the UK.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Contrast: The website has terrible contrast there is such a vomit of multiple colors its hard to focus on one part. Words pop out but they pop out everywhere on the page.</li>
                    <li>Repetition: It does a good job sometimes being consistent like the separation of spotlight cars. The rest of the site is a headache to look at as there is so much variation across the page.</li>
                    <li>Alignment: There is very minimal alignment as the page is all over the place. The lists of cars looks really weird since it is trying to sub categories different body styles.</li>
                    <li>Proximity: Some spacing then the graphics go over the dividers basically making them meaningless. The page has so many over lapping pictures and text making it hard to look at. </li>
