                <h3><a href="https://www.razer.com/" target="_blank">Razer</a></h3>
                <p>This is a gaming product producer that is known for their perepherials, laptops, and other gaming accessories.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Contrast: The contrast on the website is very well thought out as it follows the company theme. The dark background color has good contrast with bright colors. It website is very easy to read as non of the colors conflict with each other.</li>
                    <li>Repetition: It is consistent with the presentation of titles and subtitles through the subtle differences in sizes. It has clear indications of links with a simple green closing angle bracket and with a hover feature being indicated by an underline. The menu is my favorite kind of menu for a website where it tracks down with you so you can always have access to it without having to scroll back up.</li>
                    <li>Alignment: The elements that are larger or more important they centered in the page. Then the rest of the content is set in two columns the content in the column is centered and divided in rows.</li>
                    <li>Proximity: There is a really good amount of spacing between each element letting the user know that they are separate sections of content. There is a clear indication of where content end and begins in the page.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3><a href="https://www.lingscars.com/" target="_blank">LingsCars.com</a></h3>
                <p>This Website is for a car leasing business in the UK. The company has a large varity of cars to choose from and also has one of the best comments I've seen for a website in the html. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Contrast: The website has terrible contrast there is such a vomit of multiple colors its hard to focus on one part. Words pop out everywhere on the page making it impossible to look at since there is not a set color scheme.</li>
                    <li>Repetition: It does a good job sometimes being consistent like the separation of spotlight cars. The rest of the site is a headache to look at as there is so much variation across the page it is hard to follow where different sections start.</li>
                    <li>Alignment: There is very minimal alignment as the page is all over the place. The lists of cars looks really weird since it is trying to sub categories different body styles. The dividers between the spotlight cars are floting in a weird way and align to the left.</li>
                    <li>Proximity: Some spacing but the graphics go over the dividers basically making them meaningless. The page has so many over lapping pictures and text making it hard to look at or know when a new section begins.</li>
                </ul>
