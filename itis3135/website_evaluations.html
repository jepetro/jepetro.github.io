                <h3><a href="https://www.lingscars.com/" target="_blank">LingsCars.com</a></h3>
                <p>This Website is for a car leasing business in the UK. The company has a large varity of cars to choose from and also has one of the best comments I've seen for a website in the html. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Contrast: The website has terrible contrast there is such a vomit of multiple colors its hard to focus on one part. Words pop out everywhere on the page making it impossible to look at since there is not a set color scheme.</li>
                    <li>Repetition: It does a good job sometimes being consistent like the separation of spotlight cars. The rest of the site is a headache to look at as there is so much variation across the page it is hard to follow where different sections start.</li>
                    <li>Alignment: There is very minimal alignment as the page is all over the place. The lists of cars looks really weird since it is trying to sub categories different body styles. The dividers between the spotlight cars are floting in a weird way and align to the left.</li>
                    <li>Proximity: Some spacing but the graphics go over the dividers basically making them meaningless. The page has so many over lapping pictures and text making it hard to look at or know when a new section begins.</li>
                </ul>
