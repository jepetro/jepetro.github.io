            <h3>Evaluation list</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>There is a clear repetitive layout that ties the pages together.</li>
                <li>Contrast overall is very good you are able to get away with the white text by using a darker grey with low opacity.</li>
                <li>You should try to make the image have a slightly lower opacity as some of the page titles and created by in the footer get lost in the image.</li>
                <li>Proximity and alignment looks good nothing seems wildly out of place.</li>
                <li>I will say since most of the pages are left align the other half on bigger monitors looks kind of empty.</li>
                <li>You need to include your validation buttons but since their ugly I would try to make some that follow the design of the page.</li>
                <li>Make sure any links that go outside of the page open in a new tab.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Overall looks good and I was just thinking that if you wanted to add a favicon you could use the crown Q, good luck.</p>
