                    My hobby is airsoft I've been doing this hobby/sport for about 5 years now. If you don't know anything about airsoft I'll give you the general idea of the sport. 
                    Airsoft is something similar to paintball but rather than paint being the projectiles 6mm plastic balls are the projectiles. 
                    The sport uses replica like weapons to shoot each other in team vs team play or one for all. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I love the sport I know I didn't explain alot about it here but that's what the other pages are for. Anyways I am greatful for the oportunities the sport has given me and the places I've gone. 
                    It's taken me all over NC even to SC, VA, and even all the way out to CA. I am happy to share the sport with other's and would hope that it peaks some people's interest in the sport.

                    These are the airsoft guns that I use whenever I go out and play airsoft. There are many types  of ways of propelling the bbs but both examples here use gas as a propellant. The rifle set up is called an hpa setup
                     which uses high powered gas like a paintball gun but it shoots the 6mm bbs rather than paint. The bottom one uses what is called green gas which is basically propane but with out the smelling agent and it 
                     also has an added oil to make sure all o rings and metal parts are well oiled while functioning.

                    So there are really two different types of fields the first being Indoor fields which usually are set up in some kind of building or warehouse. On the other hand there is outdoor fields which are somekind of field set up 
                    outside or even a game set in the woods. Both have their benefits and downfalls I personally played at outdoor fields for a long time but had wished someone would make an indoor field in NC but their hasn't been one yet.

                    Airsoft follows some typical team based sport set up in that there is usually two or more teams that are against one another to complete some kind of objective. That is why I consider airsoft to be a sport as you engage 
                    in a team based environment. Most common form of gameplay is called team deathmatch where two or more teams play against each other to elimate the other team and win the round or game overall. But there are many other
                    types of gameplay that are sometimes derrived from video games and played out at a field.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A lot of times when you play airsoft there will be events held based around sometype of gameplay which can range from night games to structured games like the event held at ballack a field in virgina that did an event
                    around the meme of storming area 51. Since airsoft can be pretty heavily team based groups of friends will usually end up creating teams and signing up for events to participate in. Some times these events can be 
                    competitive events one in particular that me and my team participated is called SpeedQB which you can find more about that on the SpeedQB page.

                    I thought that the best way to describe the sport is through SpeedQB's own description of the sport.
                    Established in 2016, SpeedQBÂ® is the premier competitive airsoft league format.  SpeedQB foregoes the traditional limitations of airsoft, offering a fast-paced, competitive format for airsoft teams to compete and shine 
                    on a worldwide stage.  As a result, SpeedQB has evolved what was traditionally a game, into an international Sport community, complete with regional events, standardized field configurations, rules & regulations, and 
                    rankings.

                    I hope you enjoyed my page about my hobby this is something I was really passionate about but since I've been at college I haven't really been able to enjoy the sport I love so much. Most of this is due to the fact that 
                    I have been living on campus so can't really bring airsoft guns on campus. Which is why next year hopefully I can get back into the sport that I've been unable to enjoy for a while now. The thing I miss most is the 
                    community it brings together after a long day of playing. 
                </p>

                    I am 20 years old now and ever since my trip to California with three of my friends I couldn't get airsoft out of my head I went on many other trips after that to other states on the east coast but I will always cherish
                    the memories that this sport has given me especially from that trip. I know this wasn't much about me but I was glad to share something I'm passionate about I hope you enjoyed it.
