            <h2>Family Missions Company</h2>
            <p>Family Missions Company sends out lay Catholic families and singles to proclaim Jesus Christ and His Gospel to the poor! Since their ministryâ€™s founding as a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in 1997, they have trained and sent out hundreds of families and individuals to serve as evangelists and servants to the poor around the world. They feel blessed as they watch their missionary family continue to grow as billions of people still wait to hear the Good News.</p>
