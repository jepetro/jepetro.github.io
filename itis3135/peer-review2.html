            <h3>Evaluation list</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The design looks good there is a consistent theme to the site between pages.</li>
                <li>Contrast is good everything is easy to read and has a clear distinction between headers and paragraph text.</li>
                <li>Well aligned and good proximity management.</li>
                <li>Missing somekind of page header would say you could include it in the nav section but clearly indicate it is the name of the site.</li>
                <li>No footer and missing created by and validation buttons.</li>
                <li>Any links that lead away from the site I would say best practice is to have them open in a new tab.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Overall i love the page design and think it will look great in the end good luck.</p>
